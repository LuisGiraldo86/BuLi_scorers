# Bundesliga Historical Scorers

## Introduction

The goal of this small project is to collect all goal scorers since the beginning of 1.Bundesliga until the 2021-22 season.

The data was retrieved from the Deutscher Fu√üball Bund (DFB) on line archives.

## First steps

The data was obtained through web scrapping and this task was completed in the Python script `scrapping Scorers.py`. Firstly we obtained two datasets:

1. `scorer_table.csv`, that ontains the historical "ranking" of 1.Bundesliga goalscorers;
2. `spielers.csv`, that contains some info regarding the footballl players.

It is not difficult to imagina that the data is not clean. We detected two phenomena: there are some players without nationality and, there is no a real ranking. This last assertion is based in the fact that in the raw data many players have no ranking.

Then, we have a second task at hand: cleaning the data.
